# CodTech_Task_2 – Automated Report Generation 📊

This project is a part of my internship at CodTech.  
The goal is to create a Python script that generates a PDF sales report from a given CSV file.

---

## 📝 Project Overview

The script reads product sales data, calculates key insights like:
- Total sales
- Top-performing product
- Product-wise breakdown

Then, it formats and exports these details into a professional PDF report using the FPDF library.

## 📁 Files in this Repository

- report_generator.py – Python script for generating the report  
- sales_data.csv – Sample dataset used for testing  
- sales_report.pdf – Output PDF file generated by the script

## ⚙ How to Run the Script

Make sure you have Python installed, then run the following:

```bash
pip install pandas fpdf
python report_generator.py

## 📸 Sample Output
